#This repository has answers to tasks covering the following topics:

- ES6
- New features introduced in ES6
- The difference between a constant and a variable
- Block-scoped variables
- Arrow functions and function parameters default to them
- Rest and spread function parameters
- String templating in ES6
- Object creation and their properties in ES6
- Iterators and for-of loops

# The following are the questions

0. Modify

function taskFirst to instantiate variables using const
function taskNext to instantiate variables using let

1. Given what you’ve read about var and hoisting, modify the variables inside the function taskBlock so that the variables aren’t overwritten inside the conditional block.

2. Rewrite the following standard function to use ES6’s arrow syntax of the function add (it will be an anonymous function after)

3. Condense the internals of the following function to 1 line - without changing the name of each function/variable.

Hint: The key here to define default parameter values for the function parameters.

4. Modify the following function to return the number of arguments passed to it using the rest parameter syntax

5. Using spread syntax, concatenate 2 arrays and each character of a string by modifying the function below. Your function body should be one line long.

6. Rewrite the return statement to use a template literal so you can the substitute the variables you’ve defined.

7. Notice how the keys and the variable names are the same?

Modify the following function’s budget object to simply use the keyname instead.

8. Rewrite the getBudgetForCurrentYear function to use ES6 computed property names on the budget object

9. Rewrite getFullBudgetObject to use ES6 method properties in the fullBudget object

10. Rewrite the function appendToEachArrayValue to use ES6’s for...of operator. And don’t forget that var is not ES6-friendly.

11. Write a function named createEmployeesObject that will receive two arguments:

departmentName (String)
employees (Array of Strings)

12. Write a function named createReportObject whose parameter, employeesList, is the return value of the previous function createEmployeesObject.
